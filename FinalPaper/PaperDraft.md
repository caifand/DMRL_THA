[Motivations of open access movement]
[Basic forms of open access: Green/Gold; open access repositories/journals]
[Copyright and business model of open access]
[Open access policy vs. open access mandate]

## Research Questions

[Literature review 1 introduces Hypothesis 1: the increase of open access repositories affects the transition of conventional publishers into open access models]
### RQ 1: Does the growth trend of open access repositories over time affects publisher’s adoption of the open access publishing model?

[Literature review 2: current research on the impact of open access on research impact]
### RQ2a: Does the adoption of open access model correlates with the research impact of academic journals?
### RQ2b: Does the adoption of open access policy correlate with the research impact of high education institutions?

## Data Sources
Data source 1: Detailed information about open access journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals, current at March 2019
