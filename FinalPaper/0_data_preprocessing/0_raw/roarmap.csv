2) The primary purpose of hosting data in IGOR is to facilitate data sharing for the purposes of data reuse and contributing to open science.

3) The researcher shall deposit their published articles (e.g. pdf, .doc, .docx) on IGOR following the legal aspects on self-archiving and Open Access to repositories.

4) Data deposited in IGOR will be in a static, “final” state, though there are no restrictions on uploading new or updated versions of a dataset. Data producers interested in the periodic preservation of continuously updated (streaming) data should contact the IndraStra Global Open Repository Administrator i.e., IGOR Administrator (igor@indrastra.com) to discuss best practices for curating streaming data.

5) IndraStra Global is committed to maintaining and preserving access to the content in IGOR and ensuring that all of the files in the repository are retrievable. Our Minimum Deposit Requirements (specifically, our requirement for non­proprietary representations of datasets) are meant to facilitate the long­term preservation and accessibility of content in the repository.

5.1) Minimum Deposit Requirements

In order to make deposited datasets usable by others, IGOR has a minimum set of requirements that all data deposits must meet.

5.1.1.) Each data file must be presented with at least a minimal data dictionary that describes the data elements presented in the data file. The data dictionary must be submitted in a non­proprietary format (e.g. .txt, .tif).

5.1.2) Data files must be presented, where possible, in a non­proprietary format (e.g. .txt, .tif). IGOR will accept proprietary file formats where non­proprietary formats are not available or where non­proprietary formatting makes the data file substantially less usable. Proprietary formats may be submitted alongside non­proprietary formats to facilitate near­term reuse of data.

5.1.3) Deposited datasets must be presented with sufficient documentation to describe the deposited dataset or data collection in the form of a readme file. Such documentation should, at the minimum, include a description of the files in the data collection and be presented as a text file. IGOR Administrator can provide guidance and assistance for providing non­proprietary formats/formatting and the creation of data dictionaries and readme files.

6) The upper limit on uploading individual files is 50GB per Data Set. For files larger than 50GB, IGOR Administrator will work with the service provider (Zenodo) to determine whether and how IGOR can accommodate these files.",1/10/2018,https://www.indrastra.com/p/igor.html,IGOR Administrator,multiple_research_orgs,https://www.indrastra.com/p/igor.html,https://zenodo.org/communities/igor/,,6,author_retains,not_applicable,administrative,1/22/2018 12:00,,IGOR Administrator,article,http://roarmap.eprints.org/id/eprint/1756,5279,no

In accordance with State of Illinois Public Act 098-0295, the Open Access to Research Articles Act, all Illinois public universities are required to make research produced by its faculty accessible to all.
Each faculty member is strongly encouraged to retain all copyright rights for all scholarly articles that they publish or produce.
Each faculty member grants Northern Illinois University permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and grants Northern Illinois University license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles provided these are not sold.
This policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of the faculty except for any articles published before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. This policy does not transfer copyright ownership, which remains with faculty authors under existing Northern Illinois University policy, unless the author chooses to transfer the copyright to a publisher.
Application of the license will be waived for a particular article or access delayed for a specified period of time upon expressed direction by a Faculty member to Northern Illinois University.
To assist the university in disseminating and archiving the articles, each faculty member will provide an electronic copy of his or her final version of the article to Northern Illinois University by the date of its publication. Northern Illinois University will make the articles available in an open access repository, Huskie Commons. When appropriate, a faculty member may instead notify Northern Illinois University if the article will be freely available in another repository or as an open-access publication.
The University Council, in consultation with the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost, will review the policy within three years, and present a report to the faculty. The faculty calls upon the University Council and Northern Illinois University to develop and monitor mechanisms that would render implementation and compliance with the policy as convenient for the faculty as possible.",12/3/2014,http://www.niu.edu/provost/policies/appm/I13.pdf,Northern Illinois University,research_org,http://www.niu.edu/index.shtml,http://commons.lib.niu.edu/,,7,author_retains,yes,faculty,7/2/2015 8:03,,Northern Illinois University,article,http://roarmap.eprints.org/id/eprint/793,943,yes
