# DMRL_THA

This repository is dedicated to all the class assignments completed in the course Data Management and Research Cycle, Spring 2019.

## Files in the repo
1. [THA1](THA1/) contains sample data compiled from three source datasets. These datasets are mainly about open access journals and journal rankings. In response to THA1, I also created a notebook file documenting profiles of these datasets and the sample compilation process. See [THA1.ipynb](THA1/THA1_doc.ipynb).

2. [THA2](THA2/) contains a tentative proposal for the final project. The proposal is still in continuous evolution.

3. [THA3](THA3/) contains three files: an input .csv data file, a data dictionary file (in .csv format), and an output word document.

4. [THA4](THA4/) contains a folder and 4 files. The folder [**_input_**](THA4/input/) includes 2 original data files in csv format. The workflow is instantiated in the notebook file [THA4_dcf_apr26.ipynb](THA4/THA4_dcf_apr26.ipynb). An abstract visual depction of the workflow can be found as [THA4_Workflow.png](THA4/THA4_Workflow.png). One output of the workflow, a merged dataset, is contained in an csv file named [THA4_output.csv](THA4/THA4_output.csv). The variables in the output dataset is described in detail in [THA4_DataDict.csv](THA4/THA4_DataDict.csv).

5. [FinalPaper](FinalPaper/) contains all the input, intermediate, and output files for the final project. Here is the detailed file list, with nested bullet points indicating the tree structure of the files:  
   - [0_data_preprocessing](FinalPaper/0_data_preprocessing/) includes all the files used for Step 0: data preprocessing.  
   All the raw datasets can be found in [0_raw](FinalPaper/0_data_preprocessing/0_raw).  
   The code for data preprocessing can be found in [1_code](FinalPaper/0_data_preprocessing/1_code).  
   2 preprocessed datasets and a data dictionary sit in [2_output](FinalPaper/0_data_preprocessing/2_output).  
   - [1_analysis](FinalPaper/1_analysis) contains a R script for Step 1: data analysis.  
   - [2_draft](FinalPaper/2_draft) contains 2 deliverables for the final project: paper proposal & final paper.  
   - [3_presentation](FinalPaper/3_presentation) contains slides for the final presentation.  
   - A workflow chart can also be found in the [FinalPaper](FinalPaper/) folder.
