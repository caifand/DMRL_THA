# DMRL_THA

This repository is dedicated to all the class assignments completed in the course Data Management and Research Cycle, Spring 2019.

## Files in the repo
1. [THA1](THA1/) contains sample data compiled from three source datasets. These datasets are mainly about open access journals and journal rankings. In response to THA1, I also created a notebook file documenting profiles of these datasets and the sample compilation process. See [THA1.ipynb](THA1/THA1_doc.ipynb).

2. [THA2](THA2/) contains a tentative proposal for the final project. The proposal is still in continuous evolution.

3. [THA3](THA3/) contains three files: an input .csv data file, a data dictionary file (in .csv format), and an output word document.

4. [FinalPaper](FinalPaper/) contains the most current draft outline of the final paper.
