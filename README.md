# DMRL_THA

This repository is dedicated to all the class assignments completed in the course Data Management and Research Cycle, Spring 2019.

## Files in the repo
[THA1](THA1/) contains sample data compiled from three source datasets. These datasets are mainly about open access journals and journal rankings. In response to THA1, I also created a notebook file documenting profiles of these datasets and the sample compilation process. See [THA1.ipynb](THA1/THA1_doc.ipynb).
