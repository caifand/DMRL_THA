# Intended Topic for Final Project
**_ Caifan Du, Spring 2019 _**

Software becomes increasingly significant research products as well as instruments for effective research. While it is very common for a general researcher to run a statistical analysis using a piece of statistic software like SPSS or STATA; some academic disciplines, such as astronomy, physics, and bioinformatics, etc., rely heavily on specialized software to generate meaningful research results and outputs. Yet, there exists insufficient acknowledgement for software in the final product of most scholarly work, namely, research papers. The mention and description of software in research publications would increase the visibility of research work realized in software; and in this way contribute to the reproducibility of research and deserved credit of software work in research. Many inspired by data citation policy and practices, emerging institutions seek to establish software citation policies in the existing scholarly ecosystem. Give this background, for the final project, I intend to study the following topics:

* Identify existing software citation policies and corresponding policy-making organizational entities
* Examine the impact of these software citation policies, current software citation practices in scolarly work, and the changing practice that could be attributed to policy change
* Possibly compare with data citation policy and the attendant practice change, in order to gain insight into what aspects of software should be considered while making related citation policies
